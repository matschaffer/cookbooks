# ClusterServiceDiscovery --
#
# Allow nodes to discover the location for a given service at runtime, adapting
# when new services register.
#
# Operations:
#
# * provide a service. A timestamp records the last registry.
# * discover all providers for the given service.
# * discover the most recent provider for that service.
# * get the 'public_ip' for a provider -- the address that nodes in the larger
#   world should use
# * get the 'public_ip' for a provider -- the address that nodes on the local
#   subnet / private cloud should use
#
# Implementation
#
# Nodes register a service by setting the +[:cluster][:services][service_name]+
# attribute. This attribute is a hash containing at 'timestamp' (the time of
# registry), but the service can pass in an arbitrary hash of values to merge
# in.
#
module ClusterServiceDiscovery

  # Find all nodes that have indicated they provide the given service,
  # in descending order of when they registered.
  #
  # If :within_last is passed as an option, only return servers
  # registering for the service within the last given seconds.
  #
  # If :since is passed as an option, only return servers registering
  # for the service since the given time.
  #
  # If :at_least is passed as an option, try to return at least the
  # given number of servers, even if they violate the constraints
  # given above.  If fewer servers are available than requested, even
  # after violating the above constraints, then we give up and return
  # the most we can.
